The goal of this project is to show how the buying process works when buying a specific product and what product to buy with it.  
Key Components:
Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

Imports necessary packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, mlxtend)

Loads a dataset called "bread basket.csv"

Shows the first few rows of the data which contains transaction IDs, items purchased, datetime, period of day, and weekday/weekend information

Data Preprocessing:

Checks for missing data and data types

Transforms the transaction data into a binary matrix format suitable for association rule mining

Each row represents a transaction, each column represents an item, with 1/0 indicating presence/absence

Association Rule Mining:

Uses the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets

Generates association rules from the frequent itemsets

Visualizes the results (though the visualization code isn't fully shown)

Key Insights:

The dataset contains 20,507 entries with bakery transaction data

There are 94 unique bakery items in the dataset

The data is being prepared for market basket analysis to find which items are frequently purchased together

Suggestions for Improvement
Data Exploration:

Add more exploratory visualizations (item frequency plots, time-based patterns)

Analyze purchase patterns by time of day or day of week

Association Rule Mining:

Experiment with different support and confidence thresholds

Add interpretation of the generated rules

Code Organization:

Add more markdown cells to explain the analysis steps

Include comments explaining key transformations

Output:

Show the actual association rules generated

Include visualizations of the rules (like network graphs)
